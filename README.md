# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

The answers I sought to answer included:
What is the most common ride duration?
What times of day does the system get the most usage?
How much does ridership vary over the course of a month?
What are the most used stations?
How old are the riders?


The dataset I analyzed was for Jersey City in the month of March 2020. 

Phenomena and observations:

- The most common trip duration is three minutes. 
- Morning rush (between 7 and 8 AM) and evening (between 4 and 7 PM) rush hours are when the system gets used the most.
- Ridership is higher on weekdays.
- The Grove Street PATH station is the most popular station for starting journeys.
- Most riders are daily users, the data they provide for their genders and ages do not seem to be accurate. 

- These findings are expected as they seem to align with commuting for work.
